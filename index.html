        It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. If you do too much it's going to 
        lose its effectiveness. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which
         way works best for you. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. I'll 
         go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue,
          Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. These little son of a 
        guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.
